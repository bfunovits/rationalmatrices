# A Package for Rational Matrices

`rationalmatrices` collects classes, methods and tools for creating and manipulating rational matrices, i.e. matrices whose entries are rational functions.
It provides the fundamentals for the R package `RLDM` (Rational Linear Dynamic Models).
   
## Installation

`remotes::install_github("bfunovits/rationalmatrices")`

## Classes

There exist many different representations for rational matrices. 

This package in particular deals with 

* **left matrix fraction** representations (ARMA), implemented as `lmfd` class,
* **right matrix fraction** representations, implemented as `rmfd` class, and 
* **state space** representations, implemented as `stsp` class. 

As a special case, polynomial matrices, as `polm` class, and Laurent polynomial matrices, as `lpolm` class, which allow for negative powers are implemented as well.
The latter class is special in the sense that even though it is a superset of `polm` object, it cannot be coerced to `stsp`, `lfmd`, or `rmfd` objects and interaction with other classes does not make sense in many cases.

The coefficients of the power series expansion of the rational function are stored as `pseries` objects and a collection of values of the rational function may be stored as `zvalues` objects. 

The package offers tools to convert one representation into another (equivalent) representation. 
Some of these methods are quite sophisticated, e.g. `pseries2stsp` is based on the Ho-Kalman Realization Algorithm.

## General Matrix Methods

The package provides "standard" generic functions for these objects: 

* General methods, like `print`, `dim`, `plot`.
* Arithmetic operations, like addition and (matrix) multiplication.
* Extract parts of the matrix, transposition, (column or row) bind two or more matrices.

## Special Methods

The package also provides some specific methods for rational matrices:

* Compute **poles and zeroes** of rational matrices.
* Check properties of the rational matrix, like **stability** and inverse stability. 
* **Normal Forms** for polynomial matrices, like the Hermite normal form, the Smith form, and the Wiener-Hopf factorization. 
* Check for **left primeness** with `is.coprime()`
* Compute the **derivative** (with respect to $z$)
* Tools related to state space representations, e.g. computation of **controllability and observability** matrices.
