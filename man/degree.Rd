\title{Polynomial Degree}
\usage{
degree(x, which = c("elements", "rows", "columns", "matrix"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A polynomial matrix, i.e. an object of class \code{\link{polm}}.}

\item{which}{(character string) decides whether a matrix with the respectives degrees 
of the entries of the matrix, or a vector with the respective maximal 
degrees in each row or column, or simply the maximum degree of all 
elements of the polynomial matrix is computed.}
}
\value{
The outcome depends on the parameter \code{which}: 
\item{elements}{A matrix with the degrees of the respective elements 
               of the polynomial matrix.}
\item{rows}{A vector with the maximum degrees within each row.}
\item{columns}{A vector with the maximum degrees within each column.}
\item{matrix}{maximum of the degrees of the elements of the matrix.}
}
\description{
Compute the polynomial degrees (of the elements) of a polynomial matrix. 
Note that for a (scalar) polynomial with zero coefficients the degree 
is set to \eqn{-1}.
}
\details{
The main advantage of setting the degree of a zero polynomial to \eqn{-1} rather than \code{-Inf}
is that indexing and assigning is programmatically easier: 
E.g., \code{p[,,(deg+2):(max_deg+1)] = 0} (in obvious notation) also works when \code{deg = -1}.
When multiplying with zero polynomials, it does not make a difference whether one needs to check for \code{deg = -Inf} or \code{deg = -1}.
