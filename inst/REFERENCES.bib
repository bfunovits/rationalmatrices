  abstract  = {An algorithm is presented in this paper for computing state-space balancing transformations directly from a state-space realization. The algorithm requires no "squaring up" or unnecessary matrix products. Various algorithmic aspects are discussed in detail. A key feature of the algorithm is the determination of a contragredient transformation through computing the singular value decomposition of a certain product of matrices without explicitly forming the product. Other contragredient transformation applications are also described. It is further shown that a similar approach may be taken, involving the generalized singular value decomposition, to the classical simultaneous diagonalization problem. These SVD-based simultaneous diagonalization algorithms provide a computational alternative to existing methods for solving certain classes of symmetric positive definite generalized eigenvalue problems.},

  abstract  = {In this paper the question of estimating the order in the context of subspace methods is addressed. Three different approaches are presented and the asymptotic properties thereof derived. Two of these methods are based on the information contained in the estimated singular values, while the third method is based on the estimated innovation variance. The case with observed inputs is treated as well as the case without exogenous inputs. The two methods based on the singular values are shown to be consistent under fairly mild assumptions, while the same result for the third approach is only obtained on a generic set. The former can be applied to Larimore type of procedures as well as to MOESP type of procedures, whereas the third is only applied to Larimore type of algorithms. This has implications for the estimation of the order of systems, which are close to the exceptional set, as is shown in a numerical example. All the estimation methods involve the choice of a penalty term. Sufficient conditions on the penalty term to guarantee consistency are derived. The effects of different choices of the penalty term are investigated in a simulation study.},

The classes of functions considered range from rational and continuous matrix functions to matrix functions with almost periodic or even semi almost periodic entries. Also included are recent results about explicit factorization based on the state space method from systems theory, with examples from linear transport theory. Related applications to Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problems and the Fredholm theory of various classes of singular integral operators are described too. The applications also concern inversion of singular integral operators of different types, including Wiener-Hopf and Toeplitz operators.},
